Based on the search results, here are some of the most common coding challenges you might encounter in a Meta Security Engineer interview:

1. Basic text parsing and manipulation, especially related to security logs. For example:
   - Reading a file of webapp logs and identifying lines suggesting SQL injection attacks
   - Parsing Netflow logs to find the most active source IP address

2. Simple network-related tasks, such as:
   - Writing a network sweep scanner (iterating through a list of IPs and pinging each one)
   - Using the Requests library in Python to send HTTP requests and process responses

3. String manipulation problems, like:
   - Determining if two strings are anagrams
   - Reversing a word without using built-in functions

4. Data structure usage, particularly working with lists and dictionaries

5. Basic algorithmic problems, typically at the "LeetCode easy" level, with some medium-level questions possible

6. API integration and automation tasks

The difficulty level is generally described as "nothing complicated" and "fairly basic problems with multiple solutions"[4]. While some coding skills are expected, the focus is more on security-specific applications rather than pure software engineering problems. Interviewers are often more interested in your problem-solving approach and ability to explain your thought process[1][2].

It's important to note that the coding portion is just one part of the interview process, which also includes security design, technical security questions, and behavioral interviews[1][3].
